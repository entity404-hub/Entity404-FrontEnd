  <p>This international bestseller explores the two systems that drive how we think: the fast, intuitive system (System 1) and the slower, more deliberate system (System 2). Kahneman, a Nobel laureate in economics for his work on judgment and decision-making, presents complex psychological concepts in an accessible way, offering profound insights into behavioral economics, cognitive biases, and why we make the choices we do.</p>

<div id="book-other-3">
  <p>Goleman popularized the concept of emotional intelligence (EI),arguing that non-cognitive skills like self-awareness, self-regulation, empathy, and social skills can be as important, if not more so, than traditional IQ for success in life and work. The book draws on modern brain and behavioral research to show how EI can be nurtured and strengthened at any age, impacting health, relationships, and professional success.</p>
